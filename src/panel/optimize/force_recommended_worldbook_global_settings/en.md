# Forcely use recommended worldbook global settings

Specifically, the recommended global settings are as follows:

- Scan Depth: 2
- Context %: 100
- Budget Cap: 0
- Min Activations: 0
- Max Depth: 0
- Max Recursion Steps: 0
- Insertion Strategy: Character Lore First
- Include Names: false
- Recursive Scan: true
- Case Sensitive: false
- Match Whole Words: false
- Use Group Scoring: false
- Alert On Overflow: false

Currently, character card authors take these global settings as a default, so there is no need for you to modify them.

However, some old worldbooks may require you to disable recursive scan. In this case, please use the "Disable recursion of worldbook entries in one click" script in the built-in library to process it.

# Update worldbook when using `Replace/Update`

SillyTavern has a `More... → Replace/Update` function in the character card panel.

However, through this function, vanilla SillyTavern only updates the character card itself (avatar, description, first message etc.), not the worldbook data that has already been imported.

This optimization fixes this: When enabled, `Replace/Update` will also update the worldbook bound to the character card.
